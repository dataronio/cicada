- find Test
- old test as code
- json support
- list_length
- list_map
- vec_length
- vec_map
- vec_append
- join
- pre -- subtype relation
  - not just subtype relation
    because a value pre its type
- nat toInt for testing
- check
- [test] MemberTypeValue can be used as type, just by using `The`
- compile to js with runtime type information
  - this means keep Value serde-able
    - Value includes FnValue which contains Exp
      this Exp is also serde-able
* syntax
- renew parsing-tech
- lexing/
- parsing/
* set, type, cat
- what is the difference between set, type and cat ?
  - set: ==, member relation, subset relation
  - type: ==, member relation
