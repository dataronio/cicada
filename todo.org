* cicada
- eval for cicada without_logic_variable
- class and extends
- module system
- partially filled data can be used as type
- compile to js with runtime type information
  - this means keep Value serde-able
    - Value includes FnValue which contains Exp

- how to extend tartlet to define new types?
  - keep tartlet subrecursive
    but be generic about data and ind, rec and iter
