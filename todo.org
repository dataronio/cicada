* cicada
- check
- [test] MemberTypeValue can be used as type, just by using `The`
- compile to js with runtime type information
  - this means keep Value serde-able
    - Value includes FnValue which contains Exp
      this Exp is also serde-able

- nat_factorial
- bool
- nat_even_p
- list_map
- vec_length
- vec_map
- vec_append
* partech
- ExampleRule
- sexp example
- TreeTo
- parse error reporting
- [maybe] WordPred for error reporting
- linear time parser for all context free grammar with epsilon
- test partech by cicada syntax -- read file from lib/core
* set, type, cat
- what is the difference between set, type and cat ?
  - set: ==, member relation, subset relation
  - type: ==, member relation
  - cat: ==, |
* tartlet
- better expDSL
- the little typer as test
* minitt
- examples
- better expDSL
- operational semantics
- Normal expressions and Readback
- Typing Rules
