- [tartlet] change the style to grouping by function instead of grouping by data
- [tartlet] concrete syntax
* tartlet
- the little typer as test
- how to extend tartlet to define new types?
  - keep it subrecursive
    but be generic about data and ind, rec and iter
* minitt
- be sure about the use of Pattern
  - write some notes
  - Norm do not use Pattern
* cicada
- subtype relation between club and members and class and supers
  recursively extended to fields in record and pi and si
- eval for cicada without_logic_variable
- class and extends
- partially filled data can be used as type
- compile to js with runtime type information
  - this means keep Val serde-able
    - Val includes ValFn which contains Exp
      this Exp is also serde-able
* about grammar
- improve grammar about optional comma
- scala {} ap arg syntax for all grammars
* general
- module as value with opaque module_t
* partech
- ErrMsg and Span
- better report with ErrMsg in context
- [important] fix equals between rules -- how ? by ruleGen with uuid ?
- concrete syntax for rule
  - to use partech as more general tool out side scala
    (like the rosie pattern language)
