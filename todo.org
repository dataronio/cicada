- eval for cicada without_logic_variable
- why we have value vs exp
  - in lambda
    for redux
  - in cicada
    for redux and unification
    why unification instead of substitution ?
    System FÏ‰
- what is in a record that lambda can not express ?
- be sure about eval and apply on fn
- check
- [test] MemberTypeValue can be used as type, just by using `the`
- [problem] deep walk cost so much
- compile to js with runtime type information
  - this means keep Value serde-able
    - Value includes FnValue which contains Exp
      this Exp is also serde-able

- linear time parser for all context free grammar with epsilon
- ExampleRule
- sexp example
- TreeTo
- parse error reporting
- [maybe] WordPred for error reporting
* tartlet
- change the style to grouping by function instead of grouping by data
- better expDSL
- better Module
- better tests
- the little typer as test
- how to extend tartlet to define new types?
